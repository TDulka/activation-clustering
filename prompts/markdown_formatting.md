# Markdown Formatting Linter Prompt

Please ensure that the following markdown file adheres to the best practices and passes the markdown linter checks. Make sure to keep as much of the original text as possible. Follow these instructions:

1. **Headings**:
    - Ensure proper use of heading levels (e.g., `#`, `##`, `###`).
    - Headings should be in title case and not exceed 60 characters.
    - Ensure a single blank line between headings and other text.

2. **Lists**:
    - Use consistent list markers (e.g., `-`, `*`, `1.`).
    - Ensure proper indentation for nested lists.
    - Maintain a blank line before and after lists.

3. **Code Blocks**:
    - Use triple backticks (```) for code blocks.
    - Specify the language for syntax highlighting (e.g., ```python).

4. **Links and Images**:
    - Ensure all links are valid and use the correct markdown syntax.
    - Provide alt text for images.

5. **Line Length**:
    - Limit lines to 80 characters where possible.

6. **Whitespace**:
    - Remove trailing whitespace.
    - Ensure a single blank line at the end of the file.

7. **Emphasis**:
    - Use `*` or `_` for italics and `**` or `__` for bold text consistently.

8. **Blockquotes**:
    - Use `>` for blockquotes and ensure proper nesting.

9. **Tables**:
    - Ensure tables are properly formatted with consistent column alignment.

10. **General**:
    - Check for any markdown syntax errors.
    - Ensure the document is well-structured and easy to read.
